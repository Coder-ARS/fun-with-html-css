As I was learning web development for a few days, during this time, I got to know that HTML & CSS is not as challenging as other programming languages, it is a basic instructive language with great power, in the sense of versatility, so I thought of making a creative design.

My idea is to make a lot of circles, and arrange one another in descending order. As No. of circle is more than usual, I thought of using my other programming language skills, i.e, C++, to automate writing my HTML & CSS.
 
I used the “for” loop in C++ & also with the value of the different variable used to change the RGB value, the location on web-page, Shape & Size of each circle. Furthermore, when designs are not interesting, I expect, so I used chatGPT to create function changing value RGBs of each circle.
